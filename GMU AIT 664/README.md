Miami Housing Prices Analysis 2016

This project examines housing prices in Miami, Florida for the year 2016. It aims to identify and quantify variables closely related to the final sales price of houses in Miami.

Description:
The analysis focuses on testing two main hypotheses: Proximity to the central business district (CBD) in Miami is an important factor in home prices, and proximity to bodies of water and distance to the ocean are significant features affecting home prices. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling using linear regression and random forest regression techniques.
