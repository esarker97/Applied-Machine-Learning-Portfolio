BigMart Sales Dataset

This dataset is sourced from the BigMart sales data available on Kaggle. The dataset is in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.

The dataset contains sales information for products across various BigMart outlets. It includes features such as Item_Identifier (unique product ID), Item_Weight, Item_Fat_Content, Item_Visibility, Item_Type, Item_MRP (Maximum Retail Price), Outlet_Identifier (unique store ID), Outlet_Establishment_Year, Outlet_Size, Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Type, and Item_Outlet_Sales (the target variable).

Preprocessing steps applied to this dataset include handling missing values in 'Item_Weight' and 'Outlet_Size', encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering to create a new feature for outlet age.
