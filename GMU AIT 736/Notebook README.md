BigMart Sales Analysis Notebook

This repository features a detailed Jupyter notebook titled "BigMart_Sales_Analysis.ipynb," which provides a comprehensive examination of the data science pipeline for the BigMart Sales Prediction project. The notebook begins with data loading and preprocessing, which involves importing libraries and datasets, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. It then moves on to exploratory data analysis (EDA), where it visualizes distributions and relationships between variables, conducts correlation analysis, and assesses feature importance using the Random Forest algorithm.

The notebook continues with feature engineering, creating new features such as 'outlet age' and generating polynomial features for 'Item_MRP' and 'Item_Visibility.' In the model selection and training phase, it implements several regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and employs k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance. Model evaluation and comparison are addressed by comparing performance using the R-squared metric, visualizing actual versus predicted values, and analyzing learning curves for the bias-variance tradeoff.

Advanced statistical tests such as ANOVA and Tukey's HSD are used for categorical variables, while model interpretability is enhanced through partial dependence plots for key features. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using randomized search to optimize the Gradient Boosting Regressor. Overall, the notebook provides a thorough approach to understanding the dataset, preparing it for machine learning, and applying various models for sales prediction. The Gradient Boosting Regressor emerges as the best-performing model, achieving a mean RÂ² score of 0.5955 in cross-validation.
