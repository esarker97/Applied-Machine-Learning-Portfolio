BigMart Sales Analysis Notebook

This repository contains a single comprehensive Jupyter notebook that covers the entire data science pipeline for the BigMart Sales Prediction project.

The notebook "BigMart_Sales_Analysis.ipynb" serves as an end-to-end solution for analyzing and predicting BigMart sales data. It encompasses key steps including data loading and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection and training, model evaluation and comparison, and results analysis and interpretation.

In the data loading and preprocessing phase, the notebook imports necessary libraries, loads the dataset, handles missing values, and encodes categorical variables. The EDA section visualizes distributions of various features, analyzes relationships between variables, and identifies patterns and insights in the data.

Feature engineering involves creating new features such as outlet age and selecting relevant features for modeling. The model selection and training phase implements multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Gradient Boosting Regressor. K-fold cross-validation is used for model evaluation.

The notebook then compares model performance using the R-squared metric and visualizes actual vs predicted values for each model. Finally, it discusses model performance and provides insights on the best performing model, which is the Gradient Boosting Regressor.

This notebook is the core of the BigMart Sales Prediction project, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding the dataset, preparing it for machine learning, and implementing various models to predict sales. The analysis and results from this notebook form the basis of the project's conclusions and recommendations for future steps. By working through this notebook, users can gain insights into the factors influencing BigMart's sales and understand the effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting sales figures.
