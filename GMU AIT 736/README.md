BigMart Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict product sales for BigMart outlets. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze various factors influencing product sales across different stores. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of several regression models to predict item outlet sales.

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm. You can install these dependencies using pip by running "pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm" in your command line.

To use this project, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the Jupyter notebook "BigMart_Sales_Analysis.ipynb". The notebook contains all the code for data preprocessing, EDA, and model training/evaluation.

Contributions to improve the project are welcome. To contribute, fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes and commit them, then push to your fork and submit a pull request.
