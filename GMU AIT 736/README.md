BigMart Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict product sales for BigMart outlets using machine learning techniques. We analyze various factors influencing product sales across different stores, performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing several regression models to predict item outlet sales.

The project uses Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost, and lightgbm. To run this project, install these dependencies using pip:pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm

To use this project, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the Jupyter notebook "BigMart_Sales_Analysis.ipynb". The notebook contains all code for data preprocessing, EDA, and model training/evaluation.

We implement and compare several regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The best performing model is the Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieving a mean R2 score of 0.5955 in cross-validation.

Contributions to improve the project are welcome. To contribute, fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes and commit them, then push to your fork and submit a pull request.
