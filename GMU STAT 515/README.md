Water Quality Analysis Project

This project explores water quality data to predict potability using various machine learning models. The dataset contains water quality metrics from different water bodies, aiming to determine if the water is safe for human consumption.

Description
The project analyzes a dataset of 3276 water samples with 9 chemical properties and a binary potability indicator. It employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and multiple machine learning models to predict water potability. The analysis includes visualization techniques such as histograms, density plots, correlation matrices, and feature importance plots.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
