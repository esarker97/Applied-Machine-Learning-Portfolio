Water Quality Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter notebook contains the complete analysis of the water quality dataset, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.

Purpose
The notebook serves multiple purposes, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, model evaluation, and advanced techniques. It handles missing values, prepares the dataset for analysis, and includes various visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between variables. The notebook implements and compares several classification models, assesses model performance, and includes additional analyses such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and cross-validation.

Relation to the Project
This notebook is the core of the water quality analysis project. It encompasses all stages of the data science pipeline from initial data exploration to final model evaluation. The insights and models developed in this notebook directly address the project's goal of predicting water potability based on chemical properties. The notebook's comprehensive approach allows for a thorough understanding of the dataset and provides a basis for future improvements or applications in water quality assessment.
