Water Quality Dataset

Source
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle on January 14, 2021. It contains water quality metrics used to predict potability.

Format
The dataset is in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, containing 3276 rows and 10 columns.

Description
The dataset includes variables such as pH level, water hardness, total dissolved solids, chloramine concentration, sulfate concentration, electrical conductivity, organic carbon content, trihalomethane concentration, water turbidity, and a binary indicator of water potability. These variables provide a comprehensive view of water quality parameters relevant to determining potability.

Preprocessing
The original dataset contained missing values in the pH, Sulfate, and Trihalomethanes columns. These missing values were removed during the analysis, resulting in a clean dataset of 2011 samples. The Potability variable was converted to a categorical type for modeling purposes.
