This repository showcases a collection of my applied machine learning projects, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, predictive modeling, and deriving actionable insights from complex datasets.

Key projects include:

Housing Price Analysis in Austin, TX: Developed regression models to predict housing prices in Austin, TX. Utilized techniques like feature engineering, random forests, and gradient boosting to improve model performance. Implemented extensive data cleaning and preprocessing on a dataset of over 15,000 listings.
Housing Price Prediction in Miami, FL: Analyzed housing prices in Miami, FL using geospatial data. Applied multilinear regression and random forest models to predict home prices based on features like proximity to the central business district and water bodies.
Inflation Analysis and Forecasting: Analyzed US inflation trends using time series models like SARIMAX and Neural Prophet. Identified key economic indicators driving inflation through feature importance analysis using random forest models.
BigMart Sales Prediction: Built models to forecast product sales using techniques like XGBoost and random forests. Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis to uncover sales patterns and identify key features influencing sales.
Water Potability Classification: Developed classification models to predict water potability based on various chemical and physical properties. Implemented data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms to address this critical environmental issue.

These projects highlight skills in:

Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
Feature engineering and selection
Implementation of machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, time series)
Geospatial data analysis
Data visualization and communication of results
Python programming (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.)
Statistical analysis
Addressing real-world problems in diverse domains (real estate, retail, macroeconomics, environmental science)

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed code, analysis, and visualizations for each project. README files provide additional context on the business problems, methodologies, and key findings.
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to apply data science and machine learning techniques to a wide range of complex analytical challenges, delivering actionable insights that can drive informed decision-making.
