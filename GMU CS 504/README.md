US Inflation Analysis and Prediction

Description:
This project explores and analyzes US inflation data from 2010 to 2021 using various machine learning models. The goal is to understand the key factors driving inflation and develop accurate prediction models. The project utilizes data from reputable sources like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The analysis involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of several machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SARIMAX, and Neural Prophet. The project aims to identify the most influential features for predicting inflation rates and compare the performance of different models. Key findings include the identification of BLS Producer Price Index (PPI), wages, and education as major contributors to inflation rates. The XGBoost model showed excellent performance in multivariate prediction, while Neural Prophet proved efficient for univariate time-series forecasting.

Installation:
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, xgboost, and neuralprophet. You can install these dependencies using pip with the command: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels xgboost neuralprophet.

Usage:
The project consists of two main Jupyter notebooks: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Notebook and Modeling Notebook. To use the project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, then open and run the Jupyter notebooks in order. The EDA notebook focuses on data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis. The Modeling notebook implements various machine learning models for inflation prediction.
