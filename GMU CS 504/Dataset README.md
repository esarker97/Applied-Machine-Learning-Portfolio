The dataset used in this project is compiled from multiple sources, primarily the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The data is stored in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. The dataset contains various economic indicators related to inflation in the United States from 2010 to 2021. Key features include Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), employment data, wage information, commodity price indices, and sector-specific price changes (e.g., housing, food, energy). The data is structured with 120 rows and 82 columns, providing a comprehensive view of economic factors potentially influencing inflation.

Several preprocessing steps were applied to the raw data. These include data cleaning to handle missing values, feature engineering to create lag and rolling mean features, date formatting for time series analysis, joining multiple datasets on the 'month_year' key, and scaling of numerical features.
