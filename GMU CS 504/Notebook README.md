This project contains two main Jupyter notebooks. The first is the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Notebook. Its purpose is to focus on initial data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing. This notebook covers data loading and initial inspection, handling missing values, feature engineering, correlation analysis, distribution analysis of key variables, and time series visualization of inflation trends.

The second notebook is the Modeling Notebook. Its purpose is to analyzes US inflation data using various machine learning models. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of several regression algorithms. The models implemented are ElasticNet, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). A Stacking Ensemble model is also used to combine the predictions of these base models. The project aims to identify the most influential features for predicting inflation rates and compare the performance of different models. Key findings include the identification of CPI_core, import commodity prices, and employment data as major contributors to inflation rates. The SVR model showed the best performance in terms of MSE and R2 score among the individual models tested.

The EDA notebook provides the foundation for understanding the dataset and preparing it for modeling. The Modeling notebook builds upon this prepared data to develop and compare different prediction approaches. Together, these notebooks form a comprehensive analysis pipeline from raw data to predictive insights on US inflation trends.
