This project contains two main Jupyter notebooks. The first is the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Notebook. Its purpose is to focus on initial data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing. This notebook covers data loading and initial inspection, handling missing values, feature engineering, correlation analysis, distribution analysis of key variables, and time series visualization of inflation trends.

The second notebook is the Modeling Notebook. The Modeling Notebook implements and compares various machine learning models for inflation prediction. It includes feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Lasso regularization. The notebook implements multiple models: ElasticNet, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a Stacking Ensemble combining all these models. Model training is performed using TimeSeriesSplit for cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning is done with GridSearchCV. Performance evaluation uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score. The notebook also includes feature importance analysis using the Random Forest model and visualizations of model predictions and residuals. At the end, the best performing model (SVR in this case) is saved for future use. This comprehensive approach allows for a thorough comparison of different regression techniques in the context of inflation prediction.

The EDA notebook provides the foundation for understanding the dataset and preparing it for modeling. The Modeling notebook builds upon this prepared data to develop and compare different prediction approaches. Together, these notebooks form a comprehensive analysis pipeline from raw data to predictive insights on US inflation trends.
